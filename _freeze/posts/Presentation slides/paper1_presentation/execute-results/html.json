They analyzed 375 research results on whether psychotherapy was effective for patients. They concluded that almost no difference existed in the effects of different psychotherapy methods - effective.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Introduction to SEM {.smaller}\n\n-   SEM is a statistical method that integrates regression analysis, factor analysis and path analysis.\n-   path analysis was proposed by Wright in 1920, Spearman put forward factor analysis in 1904\n-   Path analysis examines the complicated relationship between observed variables. So path analysis can be regarded as a special SEM analysis.\n-   SEM is a confirmatory statistical method that thrives on rigorous theoretical support in the form of an hypothesized model. With SEM the hypothesized model is fit to data\n-   Compared with path analysis, SEM can simultaneously estimate the measurement indicators, latent variables, error of measurement indicators, and validity of measurement.\n-   SEM can be conducted if;\n    -   the data is multivariate normal\n    -   the sample size and the covariance matrix (that shows the relationship between variables) is provided.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Why combine Meta-Analysis and SEM?\n\n#### Limitations of Meta-Analysis Alone:\n- Analyzes only one effect (e.g., Motivation ↔ Information) at a time.\n- Cannot evaluate multi-variable relationships or mediation effects.\n\n#### Limitations of SEM Alone:\n- Requires large sample sizes; low statistical power with small samples.\n- Often subject to confirmation bias (limited comparison of alternative models).\n- Typically uses cross-sectional data, lacking cross-time reliability.\n\n#### Advantages of Combining Meta-Analysis & SEM (MASEM):\n- Integrates data across studies for higher statistical power.\n- Summarizes complex relationships among multiple variables.\n- Compares and integrates multiple models to find the best fit.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Unique Benefits of MASEM\n- Overcomes Data Gaps:\n  - Estimates relationships between variables not included together in primary studies.\n- Example:\n  - Study 1: Correlation (A ↔ B).\n  - Study 2: Correlation (B ↔ C).\n  - Study 3: Correlation (A ↔ C).\n  - MASEM: Estimates the full A ↔ B ↔ C relationship.\n- Reliability Across Time:\n  - Combines studies with different time frames for robust, cross-time results.\n- Complexity Handling:\n  - Simultaneously analyzes multiple variable relationships and mediating effects.\n  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Approaches to MASEM Analysis\n\n#### MASEM Process:\n- Integrate Correlations via Meta-Analysis:\n  - Use reported correlations or data to form a pooled correlation matrix.\n  - Preferred over covariance matrix due to scale differences across studies.\n\n-Fit SEM Using Pooled Matrix:\n  - Analyze relationships and test models.\n\n#### Univariate Method (Most Popular): \n##### Steps:\n  1. Conduct meta-analysis for each pairwise correlation..(its like conducting a separate meta-analysis for each pair of variables)\n  2. Use Fisher’s Z-transformation to obtain pooled correlations.\n  3. Fit SEM with pooled correlation matrix.\n  \n- Example: For 5 variables, 10 pairwise correlations are needed.\n- Advantages: Simpler, widely used (~95% of MASEM papers).\n\n\n### Limitations and Considerations of Univariate Method\n#### Limitations:\n- Assumes Independence: \n  - Does not consider interdependence of correlation coefficients (i.e., ignoring sampling covariance).\n- Correlation vs. Covariance:\n  - Correlation matrix lacks variability information (diagonal always = 1).\n  - Covariance matrix is richer but less commonly used in univariate methods.\n- Sample Size Controversy:\n- Various suggestions (mean, median, sum, harmonic mean).\n- Harmonic mean is often preferred to mitigate excessive sample size influence.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Multivariate approach - \n- Corrects the limitations of the univariates approach.\n- Correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables across studies are analyzed at once to obtain a pooled correlation matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\widehat{\\rho}_R}$.\n- The pooled matrix is used to fit the SEM.\n- If we assume a random-effects model, we need to estimate the between study co(variance) $\\boldsymbol{\\tau^2}_\\rho$ (aka.. heterogeneity matrix--- $\\boldsymbol{\\tau^2}_\\rho = var(u_i)$\n- In practice, the covariances are fixed to zero, while the variances are estimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Two-Stage SEM (TSSEM)\n\n- TSSEM applies Maximum Likelihood (ML) to obtain the pooled correlation matrix.\n- The approach is useful because if its accuracy and robustness in handling missing data.\n\n##### Steps in TSSEM:\nStage 1:\n\n- Integrate Correlation Matrix:\n  - Fit a multi-group SEM for population correlation matrix $\\boldsymbol{R}$.\n  - Use selection matrix $\\boldsymbol{X_i}$ to handle missing variables (has a variance of 1 in the diagonal).\n  - Test heterogeneity using chi-square difference between restricted (homogeneous) and saturated models.\nStage 2:\n- Fit Structural Equation Model:\n- Use Weighted Least Squares (WLS) with the pooled correlation matrix $\\boldsymbol{R}$.\nand its asymptotic variance-covariance matrix $\\boldsymbol{V}$.\n\n\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n::: notes\nSpeaker notes go here.\n:::\n\n## Slide Title\n\nSlide content\n\n::: aside\nSome additional commentary of more peripheral interest.\n:::\n\n## Slide Title\n\n-   Green [^1]\n-   Brown\n-   Purple\n\n::: aside\nSome additional commentary of more peripheral interest.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](paper1_presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Tab A\n\n\n\n::: {.cell output-location='slide'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](paper1_presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Tab B\n\nContent for `Tab B`\n:::\n\n##  {background-color=\"aquamarine\"}\n\n(A slide with no title)\n\n##  {background-color=\"black\" background-image=\"https://placekitten.com/100/100\" background-size=\"100px\" background-repeat=\"repeat\"}\n\n(Another slide with no title)\n\n## Slide Title {background-gradient=\"linear-gradient(to bottom, #283b95, #17b2c3)\"}\n\n## Slide Title {background-gradient=\"radial-gradient(#283b95, #17b2c3)\"}\n\n[^1]: A footnote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
