## Background {.smaller}

-   Meta-analytic SEM (MASEM) is the integration of two methods: Meta-analysis and Structural equation modeling (SEM).
-   With MASEM, we can explain the relationship between groups of variables across several studies.
-   MASEM can be applied in different fields including psychology, education, medicine, ...
-   According to the author, MASEM is not yet very popular thus the need to write the primer.

## Introduction to meta-analysis (MA) {.smaller}

-   MA refers is a set of statistical procedure used to synthesize research findings (quantitative data) from multiple studies for the purpose of obtaining a conclusion about the research question.
-   According to Glass, whether the analysis is referred to as a primary, secondary or meta-analysis dependents on how the data was analyzed.
-   When primary data collected (first time) by the researcher for a particular study and is analyzed - primary analysis.
-   When the primary data is re-analyzed by another researcher for a study, the data then becomes a secondary data and the analysis is a secondary analysis.
-   meta-analysis integrates a number of independent studies and combines these independent studies by statistical means to get a comprehensive result.
-   Smith and Glass were the earliest psychologist in the field of social science to employ meta-analysis. They analyzed 375 research results on whether psychotherapy was effective for patients. They concluded that almost no difference existed in the effects of different psychotherapy methods - effective.

## Introduction to SEM {.smaller}

-   SEM is a statistical method that integrates regression analysis, factor analysis and path analysis.
-   path analysis was proposed by Wright in 1920, Spearman put forward factor analysis in 1904
-   Path analysis examines the complicated relationship between observed variables. So path analysis can be regarded as a special SEM analysis.
-   SEM is a confirmatory statistical method that thrives on rigorous theoretical support in the form of an hypothesized model. With SEM the hypothesized model is fit to data
-   Compared with path analysis, SEM can simultaneously estimate the measurement indicators, latent variables, error of measurement indicators, and validity of measurement.
-   SEM can be conducted if;
    -   the data is multivariate normal
    -   the sample size and the covariance matrix (that shows the relationship between variables) is provided.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why combine Meta-Analysis and SEM?

#### Limitations of Meta-Analysis Alone:

-   Analyzes only one effect (e.g., Motivation ↔ Information) at a time.
-   Cannot evaluate multi-variable relationships or mediation effects.

#### Limitations of SEM Alone:

-   Requires large sample sizes; low statistical power with small samples.
-   Often subject to confirmation bias (limited comparison of alternative models).
-   Typically uses cross-sectional data, lacking cross-time reliability.

#### Advantages of Combining Meta-Analysis & SEM (MASEM):

-   Integrates data across studies for higher statistical power.
-   Summarizes complex relationships among multiple variables.
-   Compares and integrates multiple models to find the best fit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unique Benefits of MASEM

-   Overcomes Data Gaps:
    -   Estimates relationships between variables not included together in primary studies.
-   Example:
    -   Study 1: Correlation (A ↔ B).
    -   Study 2: Correlation (B ↔ C).
    -   Study 3: Correlation (A ↔ C).
    -   MASEM: Estimates the full A ↔ B ↔ C relationship.
-   Reliability Across Time:
    -   Combines studies with different time frames for robust, cross-time results.
-   Complexity Handling:
    -   Simultaneously analyzes multiple variable relationships and mediating effects.

## Approaches to MASEM Analysis

#### MASEM Process:

-   Integrate Correlations via Meta-Analysis:
    -   Use reported correlations or data to form a pooled correlation matrix.
    -   Preferred over covariance matrix due to scale differences across studies.
-   Fit SEM using Pooled Matrix:
    -   Analyze relationships and test models.

#### Univariate Method (Most Popular):

##### Steps:

1.  Conduct meta-analysis for each pairwise correlation..(its like conducting a separate meta-analysis for each pair of variables).

-   Example: For 5 variables, 10 pairwise correlations are needed.

2.  Fit SEM with pooled correlation matrix.

-   Advantages: Simpler, widely used (\~95% of MASEM papers).

##### Limitations

-   Assumes Independence:
    -   Does not consider interdependence of correlation coefficients (i.e., ignoring sampling covariance).
-   Correlation vs. Covariance:
    -   Correlation matrix lacks variability information (diagonal always = 1).
    -   Covariance matrix is richer but less commonly used in univariate methods.
-   Sample Size Controversy:
-   Various suggestions (mean, median, sum, harmonic mean).
-   Harmonic mean is often preferred to mitigate excessive sample size influence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Multivariate approach

-   Corrects the limitations of the univariates approach.

-   Correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables across studies are analyzed at once to obtain a pooled correlation matrix.

-   The pooled matrix is used to fit the SEM.

-   If we assume a random-effects model, we need to estimate the between study co(variance) $\boldsymbol{\tau^2}_\rho$ (aka.. heterogeneity matrix--- $\boldsymbol{\tau^2}_\rho = var(u_i)$

-   In practice, the covariances are fixed to zero, while the variances are estimated.

-   $$\boldsymbol{r}_i = \boldsymbol{\rho}_R + \boldsymbol{u_i} + \boldsymbol{e_i}$$ (1)

    -   $\boldsymbol{r}_i$ = sample correlation vector (lower part of the matrix).
    -   $\boldsymbol{\rho}_R$ = population correlation vector.
    -   $\boldsymbol{u_i}$ = random effects vector (we don't know this, thus we need to estimate it).
    -   $\boldsymbol{e_i}$ = error variance vector (used to measure the sampling error).

-   If we assume that there is no heterogeneity among the studies, a fixed-effect model is adopted.

-   $$\boldsymbol{r}_i = \boldsymbol{\rho}_R + \boldsymbol{e_i}$$ (2)

-   Q-statistics is used to test the heterogeneity of covariance matrices across studies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### GLS method

-   Integrates the correlation matrices across studies using traditional meta-analysis, and then fits the SEM to data.

#### limitations of GLS method

-   It can only fit traditional regression model.

-   If path or factor analysis were to be carried out, we will need to insert the pooled correlation matrix into the SEM software for analysis.

-   This method cannot provide an accurate sample size to the model.

-   It does not take account of the variation of inter-study sampling .

-   Some of the limitations of the GLS can be corrected using the Two-stage approach.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Two-Stage SEM (TSSEM)

-   Proposed by Cheung and Chan (2005)
-   Unlike the GLS approach, TSSEM approach uses SEM in both stages (integrating the data and fitting the model).
-   TSSEM applies Maximum Likelihood (ML) to obtain the pooled correlation matrix and the heterogeneity test.
-   Each study is referred to as a group
-   The approach is useful because of its accuracy in estimation compared to other methods(GLS) and robustness in handling missing data.

#### Steps in TSSEM:

##### Stage 1:

-   Integrate Correlation Matrix:
    -   Fit a multi-group SEM is used to estimate the population correlation matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$ of p variables.
    -   Use selection matrix $\boldsymbol{X_i}$ to handle missing variables (has a variance of 1 in the diagonal).
-   The model of each group (study) is: $\boldsymbol{\sum_i} = \boldsymbol{D_i} (\boldsymbol{X_i} \boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{X_i})\boldsymbol{D_i}$ (3)
    -   $\boldsymbol{\sum_i}$ = population covariance matrix.
    -   $\boldsymbol{D_i}$ = diagonal matrix of standard deviation.
    -   $\boldsymbol{X_i}$ = selection matrix that has 0s and 1s as the elements.
    -   $\boldsymbol{R}$ = correlation matrix in the i_th study.
-   fitting the above model, we can estimate the value of the population correlation coefficient and the asymptotic variance matrix.
-   the above model is fitted under the assumption that all studies have the same correlation coefficients.
-   When the assumption is relaxed (i.e the studies have different correlation coefficients $\boldsymbol{R}$), then $\boldsymbol{X_i}$ is no longer needed, and the saturated model is rewritten as:
    -   $\boldsymbol{\sum_i} = \boldsymbol{D_i} \boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{D_i}$ (4)
-   Test heterogeneity using chi-square difference between restricted (homogeneous) and saturated models. If $\chi^2$ test is significant, we reject the null hypothesis of homogeneity among studies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### Stage 2:

-   Use the pooled correlation matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$ estimated in the first stage to fit Structural Equation Model.
-   Alongside $\boldsymbol{R}$, asymptotic co(variance) matrix is obtained in the first. stage
-   Use Weighted Least Squares (WLS) with the pooled correlation matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$. and its asymptotic variance-covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{V}$.
-   ${F}\_wls = (\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r}\_model)^T {V}^-1 (\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r}\_model)$
    -   $\boldsymbol{r}$ = vector containing the lower triangular element of the sample correlation matrix
    -   $\boldsymbol{r}\_model$ = vector containing the lower triangular element of the implied covariance matrix
    -   ${V}^-1$ = the asymptotic covariance matrix from the first stage.
